# WiFi-SilentDisco

Silent Disco Solution Via Wifi - Local network. Enabling everyone to start a headphone party Silent Disco. may it be at home or Outside.

Objective:

Start with a minimal, reliable pipeline on a local LAN: OBS → OvenMediaEngine (OME) via RTMP → VLC via HLS/LL-HLS. This proves base functionality (one machine publishes; another on Wi-Fi plays). Ultra-low-latency WebRTC and sync features come later.
